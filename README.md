# WadeBot
The idea for WadeBot was inspired by an iconic character: Deadpool. I wanted to create a chatbot that combined Deadpoolâ€™s sharp wit and toughness, offering a blend of humor and efficiency in digital conversations. WadeBot is a witty, AI-powered chatbot inspired by Deadpool. It provides engaging interactions, quick answers, and playful banter, all while maintaining a unique personality. WadeBot is designed to handle common queries, offer fun responses, and make digital conversations more enjoyable. WadeBot is my submission for the global hack week August 2024 hosted by MLH.
